# Meal&Marketplace
Meal&Marketplace is a student-first web app that helps college students manage their meal plans, reduce waste by sharing leftovers, and save money by buying and selling study materials with classmates. At its core, the app tracks day‑to‑day spend, remaining balance, and pace against a student’s target budget, turning raw numbers into clear insights and gentle alerts before funds run short. When students have extra dining swipes or meal credits, they can post them as gifts or low‑cost trades with time windows and pickup locations at campus dining halls, making it easy to feed a friend or recoup a little value that would otherwise expire. The built‑in marketplace lets students list class notes and used books by course code, CRN, or ISBN, so buyers can quickly find exactly what they need at the end of term, while sellers can set prices or share for free. Trust and safety are built around campus identity: students sign in with a verified .edu email, view campus‑only listings, and can report content or users for moderation. The interface is mobile‑friendly, fast, and accessible, with straightforward listing flows, in‑app messaging for meetups or digital delivery, and automatic expiration of stale posts to keep the feed clean. Designed to be lightweight to deploy on standard static hosting, Meal&Marketplace can run as a front‑end MVP and later plug into secure payments and file delivery for digital notes, or campus‑specific rules that toggle selling versus gifting of meal credits. The result is a practical, community‑minded tool that turns idle meal value into help for peers and gives course materials a second life—saving students time, money, and stress throughout the semester.
